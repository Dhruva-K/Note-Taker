# NotesPro
## Motive
Effective note-taking skills can help bolster your ability to process information and help you track vitally important tasks and deadlines with accuracy. Digital note taking is gaining momentum because it has many advantages over handwritten notes which waste a lot of paper, require good organization of the notes which many of us dont tend to do, and as a result we always end up misplacing the important notes or fail to find the right notes at the right time.

## Solution
NotesPro is a note taking application that would store userâ€™s notes and update them in real time. A user can even dictate his notes and summarize huge texts. Users can navigate to the notes section wherein his/her notes would be displayed in a list, and there would be an editor to its right, corresponding to the selected note. The content of the notes would get updated in real time without any concern of loss of data. On pressing the voice button, speech of the user would be converted to text and get updated in the editor. Text can be summarized by clicking on the edit icon of notes.
